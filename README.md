# Chess Pairs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/armanbilge/ChessPairs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/armanbilge/ChessPairs)

A small program that generates randomized pairings for a chess tournament. Intended for informal settings (e.g., chess clubs), features such as "no-count" games aim to provide flexibility while maintaining fairness.

Pairings are optimized based on a set of criteria, with the following priority:

1. Two players should not be paired together more than once;
2. Opponents should have similar scores; and
3. Ideally, a player should alternate between and play equally as both colors.
